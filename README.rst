SieveManager
============

Sieve_ is a programming language for filtering mail. Sieve scripts are
run by the mail server and must, therefore, be uploaded to the mail server.
This is where SieveManger comes in. SieveManager is a command-line client
for uploading, downloading, and managing Sieve scripts using the
ManageSieve protocol. It can also be used as a Python module.

See the manual_ for details.
